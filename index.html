    For newbie's, a very good place to start is:
    <a href=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn</a>
    <p/>
    Highly recommended is the use of github to hold projects,
    and also exploting the ability to (freely) host project websites via github.io: 
    <a href="https://bjla93334.github.io">https://pages.github.com</a>
    <p/>
    <a href="https://github.com/bjla93334/bjla93334.github.io">github user website project</a>
